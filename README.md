 # Creating "lists" in Java
 In this project, I created the illusion of a variable size list in Java. <br>
 Usually arrays are fixed length, but this List object can be appended to after instantiation. <br>
 This is useful for situations where you don't know how many objects you are going to store at the time of instantiation, and provides the flexibility of incresing the size later on.
 
 It should be noted that this is less efficient than an array, and while it won't be noticable on small arrays, very large arrays (larger than one million elements) will be faster to read/write to/from using a standard Java fixed-length array. <br>
